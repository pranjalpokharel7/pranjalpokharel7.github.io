        <p>
          I am greatly interested in the art of computer programming. Currently
          I'm preferably looking to work next with Rust-based systems (or any
          infrastructure projects). On the fullstack side, I'm well experienced
          working with backend and database systems. Although I am familiar with
          the front-end stack as well, my interest lies in building backbones
          for systems that are robust, optimized, and secure. You can look up my
          resume from the navigation bar above.

          Keeping the website very minimal (no javascript required). I had a
          theme provider configured before, but it was simply too much of a
          hassle to keep the content consistent (also didn't like the very
          limited styling options).
