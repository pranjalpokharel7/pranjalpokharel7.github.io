        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I am greatly interested in the art of computer programming. Currently
          I'm jobless (lol) and looking to work next with Rust-based systems (or
          any low-level projects).
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping the website very minimal with no javascript required. Had a
          theme provider configured before, but it was simply too much of a
          hassle to keep the content consistent (also didn't like the very
          limited styling options).
