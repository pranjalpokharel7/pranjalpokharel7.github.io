        <p>
          I have kept the website very minimal (no javascript required). You may
          navigate the website through the links available in the navbar above.
          I had a theme provider configured before, but it was simply too much
          of a hassle to keep the content consistent (also didn't like the very
          limited styling options).
        </p>
        <p>
          I write blog posts occasionally, though there is no specific topic
          that I adhere to. Most of them are dumps of the flow state of my mind.

          You can contact me the quickest by email at
          pranjalpokharel007@gmail.com. If you want to work with me in a
          professional setting, all of my relevant links are available from the
          resume link above. Some social links are available on the footer
          below, though I am not quick to respond on those platforms.
