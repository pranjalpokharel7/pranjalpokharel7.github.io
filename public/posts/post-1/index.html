The Yakuza dance to this song, and your mom hums this while cooking. Safe to say this is the epitome of &lsquo;Japanese Inquisition&rsquo;.</p><p>At it&rsquo;s heart, it is an adorable song about your first crush, a song sure to set your heart aflutter and remind you of the 13-year-old self, day-dreaming about getting to walk along with that special someone on your way back home from school.</p><h4 id=2-centimeter---the-peggieshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvecdjo1rxow4listpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex2>2) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCDJo1rXOW4&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=2">Centimeter - The Peggies</a><a href=#2-centimeter---the-peggieshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvecdjo1rxow4listpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex2 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>Strictly speaking from my experience, but the quality of this song doesn&rsquo;t correspond with the anime <em>(Kanojo Okarishimasu)</em>. But people who can&rsquo;t keep songs out of their head, beware: the song is sure to keep your head bobbing and feet tapping on an infinite loop.</p><p>Images this song might bring up in your mind range from that time you found your chest thumping as her leg brushed past yours and that moment when you made a perfect one-one eye contact with him and suddenly found your legs wobbling.</p><h4 id=3-daddy-daddy-do---masayuki-suzuki-ft-airi-suzukihttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsnug1csfmgglistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex3>3) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNuG1Csfmgg&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=3">Daddy Daddy Do - Masayuki Suzuki ft.

Masayuki Suzuki is a legend in Japanese music and add in the mix Airi Suzuki, someone whom I <del>simped for</del> like listening to on a loop, this is a song to cherish.</p><p>This is the point where playful love turns into seductive foreplay and waiting to see who will be the first one to give in and lose head over heels. Because, let&rsquo;s be frank, love is war.</p><hr><h3 id=city-pop-for-a-trip-through-nostalgia>City Pop: For A Trip Through Nostalgia<a href=#city-pop-for-a-trip-through-nostalgia class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><h4 id=4-crazy-for-you---saito-marinahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv_hmcjaerphelistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex4>4) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hMcJAERPHE&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=4">Crazy For You - Saito Marina</a><a href=#4-crazy-for-you---saito-marinahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv_hmcjaerphelistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex4 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>This is it. The most listened to song on my mobile playlist. The only song from this list that I might forcibly play in my wedding.</p><p>Since this song, I&rsquo;ve listened to Saito Marina sing originals and cover countless other songs from the 80s but this one is pretty close to my heart. Hard to express the feelings the melody evokes in my heart - a walk along the beach, hand holding, smiling as you glance at each other, knowing that given the time and place there&rsquo;s no other place you&rsquo;d rather be than with each other.</p><h4 id=5-telephone-number---junko-ohashihttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcrgwrm6uxv8listpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex5>5) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRGwRm6uXv8&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=5">Telephone Number - Junko Ohashi</a><a href=#5-telephone-number---junko-ohashihttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcrgwrm6uxv8listpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex5 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>For some odd reason, I found myself humming this songs as I was attending a pretty serious semester exam. A song with a catchy chorus like none, this is another song to sing to your crush, and hoping he will hear your whispers from 500m away and sweep you off your feet.</p><p>Personally, this reminds me of the first time I tried flirting through the telephone and nearly broke down in nervousness before I could make it past the first minute. You get the picture. No, she and I are NOT married now.</p><h4 id=6-plastic-love---saori-hayami-coverhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcxwvf74avbqlistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex6>6) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXWVF74AVBQ&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=6">Plastic Love - Saori Hayami (cover)</a><a href=#6-plastic-love---saori-hayami-coverhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcxwvf74avbqlistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex6 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>It&rsquo;s quite hard to bring up city pop and not mention <em>Plastic Love</em>. While Mariya Takeuchi&rsquo;s original version might be much closer to people&rsquo;s hearts, there is something about this live performance that just struck a chord with me. Maybe it&rsquo;s the supreme guitar playing and the performance in perfect sync with the drums, or Hayamin&rsquo;s vocal prowess, or all of them.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t guarantee anything, but I have rarely listened to the original after I listened to this cover. As for the significance of this song for the romantic couples out there, there need not be said anything.</p><p>This song is legendary as it is.</p><hr><h3 id=slow-songs---romantic-partners-for-life-songs-for-the-end-of-the-journey>Slow Songs - Romantic Partners For Life, Songs For The End Of The Journey<a href=#slow-songs---romantic-partners-for-life-songs-for-the-end-of-the-journey class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><h4 id=7-sakura---ikimonogakarihttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnngdurlubfelistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex7>7) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNgDURlUbfE&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=7">Sakura - Ikimonogakari</a><a href=#7-sakura---ikimonogakarihttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnngdurlubfelistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex7 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>Cherry blossoms, springs, rivers, fluttering hearts - a song in perfect sync with the Japanese nature and love. Well, at least from a foreigner&rsquo;s perspective.</p><p>I might point out at this point that most of the songs I&rsquo;ve in this playlist are lyrics videos, so even if you&rsquo;re new to Japanese music, you can follow along with the translated lyrics.</p><p>Do not miss the lyrics to this song, because it is plain and simple, art.</p><h4 id=8-koi-wo-shita-no-wa---aikohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrkezywirgiwlistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex8>8) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkezyWiRgiw&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=8">Koi Wo Shita No Wa - Aiko</a><a href=#8-koi-wo-shita-no-wa---aikohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrkezywirgiwlistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex8 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>The best song from my favourite animation movie of all time, Japanese or other language. From what I&rsquo;ve watched so far, nothing comes close.</p><p>There is nothing to be ashamed of if you cried when the end credits rolled and this song came on. A beautiful, beautiful story of two people struggling with the circumstances involving each other, culminating with the perfect song.</p><p>Please cherish the ones you love, you never know when it is the last time you get to call them by their name.</p><h4 id=9-nandemonaiya---radwimpshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvx8i21_6isclistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex9>9) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8i21_6Isc&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=9">Nandemonaiya - RADWIMPS</a><a href=#9-nandemonaiya---radwimpshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvx8i21_6isclistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex9 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>I didn&rsquo;t have to struggle between this and <em>Sparkle</em>, <em>Nandemonaiya</em> is the best song from <em>Kimi no Nawa</em> by far. While I must thank the movie for introducing a lot of people to Japanese anime and songs in general, I am sure people would have loved this masterpiece with or without the movie.</p><p>A lovely song to sing on guitar to your loved one. Also the perfect movie to watch on Valentine&rsquo;s if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p><h4 id=10-kimi-no-shiranai-monogatari---supercellhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvede514xijfulistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex11>10) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDE514XIJfU&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=11">Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari - Supercell</a><a href=#10-kimi-no-shiranai-monogatari---supercellhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvede514xijfulistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex11 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>Space, night sky and star-crossed lovers, and might I say, the best song on <em>Bakemonogatari</em>. If <em>Renai Circulation</em> is the excitement of a new crush, this song is the one that echoes through the skies whispering the name of your soulmate for eternities to come.</p><p>Trust me, you won&rsquo;t regret listening to this one.</p><h3 id=kenshi-yonezu>Kenshi Yonezu<a href=#kenshi-yonezu class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><h4 id=11-lemon---kenshi-yonezuhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsx_vit4ra7klistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex11>11) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX_ViT4Ra7k&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=11">Lemon - Kenshi Yonezu</a><a href=#11-lemon---kenshi-yonezuhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsx_vit4ra7klistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex11 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>Kenshi Yonezu deserves a different category of his own - I can&rsquo;t imagine a Japanese singer more popular abroad than he is right now. And <em>Lemon</em> is his <em>magnum opus</em>.</p><p>Honestly, not all romantic love has to be between couples. This song reminds me of how much my family and friends mean to me, and how I&rsquo;d be at an utter loss if anything were to happen to them.</p><p>Incidentally, this is also the most viewed Japanese music video and rightly so - this is a song for the ages.</p><h4 id=12-orion---kenshi-yonezuhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlzayrgsqeeelistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex12>12) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzAyrgSqeeE&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=12">Orion - Kenshi Yonezu</a><a href=#12-orion---kenshi-yonezuhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlzayrgsqeeelistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex12 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>Another masterpiece. While I don&rsquo;t know how popular it is, it certainly is special. Maybe I have a thing for constellation, stars, prayers and promises.</p><p>I must admit, I was pretty torn between including this or <em>Uchihage Hanabi</em>, another romantic song that could replace well any other song from this playlist. But I eventually went with <em>Orion</em>, recency bias might have affected my judgement. Regardless, give both songs a listen, and maybe provide a verdict on which one deserves a spot here over the other.</p><h4 id=13-shunrai---kenshi-yonezuhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzknzxsacunulistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex13>13) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkNzxsaCunU&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=13">Shunrai - Kenshi Yonezu</a><a href=#13-shunrai---kenshi-yonezuhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzknzxsacunulistpl63_35iprqotj_qyjol2yseyk-iyluaqkindex13 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>And finally, my most treasured Kenshi Yonezu song of all time. While I was initially under the impression that this was some sort of dance song, I was pretty much blown away once I listened in closely with the translated lyrics.</p><p>For me, this song is the strongest in terms of lyrics from this playlist. And also the most difficult to sing along. Also the second most played song on my playlist.</p><pre><code>&quot;Kotoba ni suru no mo katachi ni suru no mo sono dore mo ga satoshi taba nakutte
Tada me o mitsume ta suruto anata wa futto yasashiku waratta n da
Shagare ta kokoro mo sazameku himitsu mo ki ga tsuke ba konagona ni natte
Setsuna no ma ni itami ni ni ta koi ga karada o hashitta n da&quot;

&quot;Putting it into words, or giving it a shape, either way, it's a bit shaky,
Because when I gazed into your eyes, you laughed, suddenly and gently,
My ragged voice, my loudly kept secret, before I knew it, they've gone to pieces,
In an instant, a love like pain had run through my body...&quot;
</code></pre><hr><p>There you have it, your lucky number 13 and my best wishes for a lovely day.</p><p>Loading something clever to end this post&mldr;</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user"><span>© 2021 Pranjal Pokharel</span>
