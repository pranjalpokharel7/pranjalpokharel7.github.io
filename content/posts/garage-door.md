I open the door to the backyard again. Time 2:30. Pitch black. 
A crow caws at me from the top of the tree. For the last seven times I've 
come out, I've never seen the crow, in any shadow or shape. The crow is black and the 
night is blind. But I know it's there, reminding me that I have not locked 
the garage door properly.

Phone battery had to die down right now. For all the little things I can't seem to 
forget, from always having to hang clothes inside out and needing to keep my slippers 
perfectly aligned against the stairs, my brain always forgets about charging the phone.

I feel around in the dark and make it to the garage door. Locked. I yank it hard 3 times - the 
lock doesn't come off. I tap lightly on the door and then pull it towards me twice. 
Locked, I can rest easy now.

I come inside and lie down on the bed. Someone pulls on the handpump again.

"Who's there?", I shout and the crow answers back. I remember the garage door. 
Did I *truly* lock it well this time?

I take a stick along with me, stretching from my extended palm to the ground. 
Perfect for close range combat.

Alas! Just like the last 8 times, there appear to be only ghosts pulling pranks. 
I check the door again. Pull the lock 3 times. Tap the door once. Pull the door handle twice.

This time, I touch the earth directly below the door. Something feels wet. I take a sip. 
Tastes salty, too salty to be underground water. In fact, a bit too viscous to be water at all.
Was someone *really* pulling on the handpump?

I strike the stick against the gorund to scare off the crow. I can hear no wings flying, but 
I assume I scared it off for the time being. A scent of a woman fills the air, 
almost perfume-ish, almost heavenly. I can't stay outside for long, I mutter to myself. 

I go inside and gently place the stick alongside the wrench. 
Something flashes in my head and I decide to re-wash the wrench in the tap water. 
For the 5th time after midnight. But no water flushes out. Instead a soft woman's voice 
hisses from the other side, reminding me that I live alone in this house now and I have 
to remember to fill up the water tank every once in a while. 

Just like I have to remember to pile up the dishes neatly in stack. 
Just like I have to remember to arrange my clothes on the basis of color, now that mom is gone.

I slither into the bed again. Someone pulls on the handpump again. 
A police siren sounds in the distance. I go outside to check the garage door again.
