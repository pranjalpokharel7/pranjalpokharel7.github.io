Here are 10 songs looping through my thick skull this month of June.

#### 1) [Paprika - Kenshi Yonezu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s582L3gujnw)
While I didn't really feel anything special about the song when I heard it a year back, my heart has really warmed up to this. Especially after listening to NHK's version sung by kids. Apparently this song will be used as cheer anthem in the Tokyo Olympics too.

The song is just pure nostalgia - climbing trees, stealing fruits from other people's garden, playing *dhyakki* and *phiyo* (local games involving sandals and stones) - everything that made my childhood worth remembering.

#### 2) [Drop Pop Candy - Reol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eyyhtOrKPI)
Oof, where do I start with this one. I'd have plastered "Drop Pop Candy" across my room walls if someone had dared me to do it in the 3-day binge I listened to this song on a loop. Fixes my mood on the gloomiest days and gets me out of my slump. Listen to "Hibikase", another song from Reol which has been on play in my playlist for a while now. As for the song in question, it is bound to stay for a while.

#### 3) [Anamanaguchi - Miku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocXEwsJGOQ)
Might I say this is the first Miku song that I really liked, considering I was never into Vocaloid before. If I start playing with Vocaloid in the next 5 years, I'll have this song to thank. Since then, this iconic song has led me down into the rabbit hole, all the while questioning myself if I truly will enjoy a normal, human-sung song from now on.

#### 4) [Polaris - Aimer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJkQzZOdOsI)
One of the few quality songs I've stumbled onto in random Discord voice channel raids. Aimer has a very distinct voice indeed, and this I can tell clearly despite having only listened to a few of her songs so far. Definitely something I play after 10 at night as I code away at my PC waiting for my sleep to kick in. As the other peeps in my house claim - weird time to play music on speakers, but okay.

#### 5) [Spring Thief - Yorushika](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw1Flgub9s8)
From "Hana ni Bourei" to "Heikousen" and now onto this song, I've grown a year older listening to Yorushika's songs. "Spring Thief" is a  trademark Yorushika song - upbeat music, superb chorus and I hope not some sad lyrics underneath because I haven't had a time to read the translated lyrics yet :eyes:

Oh did I mention "Heikousen"? Another song that just didn't make into this playlist, but one definitely warrants a listen.

#### 6) [Yasashii Suisei - YOASOBI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyvhvlYvRnc)
Honestly, listen to Ikura sing this on "The First Take". So much raw emotion and as soon as the song ends, her hands start to tremble. Truly chilling. There is not a single YOASOBI song that I have listened to and not liked to. "Yasashii Suisei (Comet)" just happened to be the latest one I listened to, and honestly a song with truly beautiful words behind it. 

Definitely staying on my playlist for a long time.

#### 7) [Dreamy Date Drive (Owarimonogatri OP) - Saito Chiwa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46azVyIDoAY)
It's not hidden truth that "Monogatari" is one of my favorite anime out there and Senjougahara Hitagi is the best girl. Just so it happens that this song crosses both those items off my list. I will agree that this is definitely not the best monogatari OP/ED out there ("Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari" takes the cake for that accolade), but this has been my go to song for this month so this goes on this list. Dreamy date indeed.

#### 8) [Everything - MISIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHIR33pOUv0)
This song is fucking legendary, and I often ask how the algorithm missed recommending me to it all these years. The other day my sister asked me about the song (trust me she has no interest in my not-so-secret weeb life, expected) and said it was really good. That settled it for me. I definitely missed adding it to my valentine playlist for 2021, but not this time. Just the vocals man, sends a shiver down my spine, reminds me of "My Heart Will Go On" from Titanic, a true masterpiece.

#### 9) [Dramaturgy - Eve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJzw1h5CR-I)
This has definitely been one of those songs that I absolutely couldn't bear to listen to before but now I have to listen to it once a day. I guess this is what it means about your music taste getting refined with time. Regardless, this is easily the best Eve song for me right now, both lyrics and music-wise, and the song that solidified Eve as one of my best Japanese Music artists. Sometimes this song feels too relatable to my daily life, but that's a topic for another day.

#### 10) [Bad Apple - Nomico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8)
It took me some time to figure out the true meaning behind this song (sike). That doesn't stop me from vibing to it. From ASCII animations to Graphing Calculators, everybody wants a piece of that bizare bad apple, and my ears just can't get enough.
