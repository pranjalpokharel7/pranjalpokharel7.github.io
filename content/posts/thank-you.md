#### To my computer teachers

To **Ashok Ghimire** sir, it impossible to forget the day when you made me 
stand in the centre of the class and demo my custom 'Windows 7 icon pack'. 
To the child who was trying to find his identity 
outside of being a student, the gesture meant the world to me. 

To **Bipin Lal Shrestha** sir, your classes were the most fun I had in school 
and ones to treasure. Hope the full-page answers I wrote to 2 marks 
questions didn't tire you back then :KEK:.

#### To my friends

To **Adarsha Thapa** and **Sitanshu Shrestha**, two of my friends from high
school, who despite being leagues ahead of me in terms of programming prowess 
and real-world skills, are still as humble as ever. To **Ankit Acharya**, my best
mate from high school through college, currently struggling against the hellish
tides of Chartered Accountant (CA) studies.

To **Nabin Ghimire** and **Laxmi Kanta Poudel**, the two idiots who saved my 
college life from being miserable. **Nabin Gautam** is probably busy partying 
with 'Australia's Top Models', but in case you see this, book me a flight 
ticket ASAP (because I need to join in, sshhh...).

To **Sanskar Amgain**, the one whom I consider to be arguably the best programmer
from our batch. **Sandesh Ghimire**, my first friend in Pulchowk and the man
with the best design sense I've met till date. **Ranju G.C.**, the perfect
project and lab partner one could ask for (and one of the few lone souls who finds 
my jokes funny).

To **Prabin Paudel**, the guy who has stuck with me through thick and thin. 
**Supriya Khadka**, whom I have troubled with mundane works more often than not,
and someone who has inspired me to take up the 'exam topper challenge'. **Sagar
Timalsena** my CR, my man, thank you for always believing in me.

To **Nikesh D.C.** for all the lab assingments and projects you've done that we have
had the privilege to copy. I will be sure to reduce your workload in the future.

#### To my *Hostel Nibbas*

A rag-tag bunch of defenders of Mother Earth, who have
taken some time off for now to cater to my needs. It is because of you guys that 
I have a new home to look forward to everytime vacation ends. 

To **Udeshya Dhungana**, the Arch-user and the man who introduced me to Vim 
(guy prefers Emacs though, for now :evil_smirk:). **Nishan Poudel**, my guitar hero,
my Florida man who has taught me to relax a bit 
and enjoy life the way it comes. Both excellent programmers, and even closer roommates.

To **Sandesh Pokhrel**, my brother from another mother, footbal maestro and 
magician. **Santosh Pangeni**, man as skinny as they come, my arch nemesis on Fifa
when it comes to playing styles. **Nikhil Aryal**, the man who couldn't say 'no',
the sword that guards the realms of men. 

To **Mukul Atreya**, fellow connoisseur of anime, someone whom I want to play the 
guitar with onstage before I graduate. **Sangam Chaulagain**, our alpha, pack 
leader, a smile ladies die for. **Tilak Chad**, my weeb buddy, Dennis Ritchie lite, the man I love the most
having intellectual conversations with. **Milan Shrestha**, someone I share 'the
same district bond' with, and whose family makes me feel like home when I visit.

To **Berma Yadav** for being patient as my
table tennis practice partner and showing me the true 'art of personal hygiene'.
**Bishnu Paudel**, the guy who has rescued me from potential exam failures on 
multiple occasions as my study guide and who waited for me in the hospital
that one critical time. **Gopal Pangeni** for showing me the importance of kindness
and hard work, here's to doing a civil project with you in the future!

To **Ujjwal Kandel** for simply existing.

#### To my seniors

To **Aashish Bhattrai**, for making me fall in love with C programming and 
showing me a dimension beyond being a library importing, javascript kiddie
(also for quality anime-music-recommendations).

To **Samip Poudel**, for showing me the beauty in pursuing pure academics and
balancing programming skills along with it (+ the art of conversation).

To **Rabin Adhikari**, for being the very man, the myth and the legend who 
helped me setup this website. I might be troubling you the most with my noob
queries, so I suggest you prepare a cup of coffee, just in case :wink:.

To **Maharshi Bhusal**, for helping me appreciate the beauty of digital 
illustrations and art in the grand scheme of things. Thank you, for those two cups of coffee and two
hours of invaluable life lessons.

To **Rajil Bajracharya**, for making me so tired of writing for college events 
that I actually started to appreciate programming ten-folds. On a serious note,
if I had to choose an older brother for life, you'd be on the top of my priority
queue :cringe:.

To **Krishna Upadhyaya**, for demonstration of how to walk a thin-line between
hostel expulsion and legendary programmer status. Fiercest supporter of Pulchowk IT 
Community from outside the college, and our one time sponsor for CP contest 
(more on that some other day).

To **Sandesh Bhusal**, for giving me an ideal to strive for. You are the ghost I 
am chasing and someone whom I want to make proud. Here's to hoping I buckle 
down, stop complaining about engineering life, and never stop 
walking. Cheers!
