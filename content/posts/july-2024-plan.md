Do not over complicate things. Programming must be pursued as the purest art. As long as you code. As long as you sacrifice your time to the pursuit of programming perfection, it's fine whatever problem you work on. Your motivations and desires are not that important - you are just the vessel through which the collective programming consciousness (aka "the programming conscience") streams onto lines of code. Let it flow and stop holding onto a notion of your "self". 

The greatest programmer in the world is the person who is able to solve the greatest programming problems in the world. What matters is not the programmer's aspirations but the questions of if and how the problem at hand was solved. The "who solves" is simply a stack of layers knowledge standing upon the brains of computing legends.

I was genuinely surprised to hear that someone like Carmack was never into coding marathons or overnight crunch mode. He always needed a "good 8hrs of sleep" to code efficiently. However, he also claimed that was because his productivity "dipped after 12hrs of work" - he could no longer write a line of code after that, efficient or not. Focused work x consistency seems to beat grandiose ideas of "hacking and coding until you collapse and then waking up to do it again". The latter notion seems sillier to me by the day. All those project submission deadlines that I worked over a stretch of more than 20-30 hrs could be easily avoided had I simply been consistently working on it since the start of the semester. I'm finding those stretches as nothing to be proud of.
