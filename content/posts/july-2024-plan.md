- Solved [h-index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/), inefficient O(n2) solution, took some time to understand other submissions.
- Merged and commented on a few company PRs.


Do not over complicate things. Programming must be pursued as the purest art. As long as you code. As long as you sacrifice your time to the pursuit of programming perfection, it's fine whatever problem you work on. Your motivations and desires are not that important - you are just the vessel through which the collective programming consciousness (aka "the programming conscience") streams onto lines of code. Let it flow and stop holding onto a notion of your "self". 

The greatest programmer in the world is the person who is able to solve the greatest programming problems in the world. What matters is not the programmer's aspirations but the questions of if and how the problem at hand was solved. The "who solves" is simply a stack of layers knowledge standing upon the brains of computing legends.

I was genuinely surprised to hear that someone like Carmack was never into coding marathons or overnight crunch mode. He always needed a "good 8hrs of sleep" to code efficiently. However, he also claimed that was because his productivity "dipped after 12hrs of work" - he could no longer write a line of code after that, efficient or not. Focused work x consistency seems to beat grandiose ideas of "hacking and coding until you collapse and then waking up to do it again". The latter notion seems sillier to me by the day. All those project submission deadlines that I worked over a stretch of more than 20-30 hrs could be easily avoided had I simply been consistently working on it since the start of the semester. I'm finding those stretches as nothing to be proud of.

- Participated in a weekly Leetcode contest ([406](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-406/)), solved 2 questions, gave up on remaining 2
- Initial learning on zk-SNARKs ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcKCW7CNu_M))
- Postgres Performance Tuning - just skimming through ([link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBrWqg4Ny6vX8e2LnQbNajGSKnFDe94kg))
- Watched some freestyle swimming technique (had been basically practicing blindly this past month)


Too many comments spoil the broth. If you write legible, well-structured code, comments are rarely necessary. Although do provide a README file to explain the motivations behind the project, with some basic instructions on how to explore the repo.

Overthinking is the root cause of procrastination. When you're tired, lay down, take a nap if necessary. "I'll take this time to catch up on some programming news" turns into "let me waste another hour of my time watching videos on why Bronny James sucks". Fast, swift execution. Think after you begin executing. I hate to repeat this mantra to myself but "just do it".

I am the only one keeping myself from succeeding. Yet only recognizing this doesn't solve the underlying issue. What is it that's stopping me from chasing my dreams? I frequently run back to the comfort offered by my mobile and social media. I overthink every little scenario instead of taking any sort of action. I can not talk to my mind if it refuses to listen.

Nostalgia does not help. Just because I worked my ass off for the last 3 weeks doesn't mean I'll do that automatically today. Just because I failed 100 times doesn't mean I'll repeat my mistakes today. Focus on the moment. Silence your mind. They are just thoughts. Immaterial, they can cause no harm.

My back seems to give out first. It whispers into my brain, "just lie down, I need some rest". I need to make my back stronger. Will start with simple rows using the 8kg dumbells I have in the room.

- Solved some edge cases at work today. Data issues are harder to debug since they don't throw syntax errors or internal server errors. Constraints can only go so far; it's really difficult to define invalid states in SQL especially when such logic bears it's roots in business requirements.
- Completed that zk-SNARK video, still require much in-depth knowledge to make everything in my head click.

I just can't find myself slacking off at work, even if I actively try to. I just can't turn my mind off if there's a problem to solve, a logic to optimize, some section to refactor. It's 8PM and I'm still pushing some company code to remote. I've often led myself to accepting exploitative work hours as a result of this. For my first job I got paid fucking $3.75 for two weeks of FE work. And I still pulled an all nighter before said work's deadline until 4 AM in the morning, just so I could "make one particular screen's responsive design a bit smoother". Capitalism will chew up your passion and spit it right at your face.

My productivity plummets after 10PM, I need to structure some useless tasks post this time (checking up on social media, say).
I'm not sure if I could wake up earlier, but I'll give it a shot tomorrow. Let's reduce sleeping time by around 15 mins tomorrow. Did not do my back exercies today, that's an L for me.

- More blockchain research (plans regarding research will be quite detailed in the future)
- Started work on optimizing existing RDS services in production

Thoughts Battleground. Constantly fighting against my own thoughts that I deem are "irrational". "We won't be able to go to swim today because we have X planned for later in the day, so let's just wake up a bit later" - IRRATIONAL. First I need the ability to discriminate between rational and irrational thoughts. My strategy for now is to list down all the irrational thoughts I have throughout the day so I can recognize the patterns. 

Second is to do some light planning before I go to bed and after I wake up. In college, my approach to prepare for exams would be to first go through the syllabus, then go through all the chapters at a glance, allocate specific duration for each chapter, adopt a 1hr study session with 5-10 mins break after. All the exams I studied this way I did better than expected. Unfortunately, there were a lot of exams when I didn't do this and I let my irrational mind take over. Planning is hard. Deciding to do something right now is harder.

"When Bitcoin was invented, the Schnorr scheme was still patent-protected, and thus Satoshi Nakamoto decided to use ECDSA as the signature scheme for Bitcoin." Fuck patents.

I'm planning to change the Hugo theme for my website. As it currently stands, the theme severely restricts long form of reading due to the small area allocated for text. Will be on the lookout for something that makes plan files more readable.

There are three things I need to target to evolve my programming skills - consistency, focus and time. My mental focus is all over the place. However, I can focus on the consistency and time part. My objective right now is to manage my time better so that I can spend maximum amount of time on learning something new. Focus is something that will compound over time. The less I think of things other than programming, the more my mind will be occupied with programming ideas. Focus is not what you let in but also what you filter out.

Taking a nap or a shower are sure fire ways to douse that initial phase of burnout.

I had the worst possible start to the day and ended up having one of the most productive days in this 4 week span. Life is full of surprises, give future possibilities a chance.
