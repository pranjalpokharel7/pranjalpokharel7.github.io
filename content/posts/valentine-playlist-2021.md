### Fast Songs: For Crushes And Anything Not Too Serious

#### 1) [Renai Circulation - Kana Hanazawa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDR0JMyoQGA&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=1)
Legend has it that Alexander The Great listened to this *Bakemonogatari  Opening* before he set out to see, go and conquer. The Yakuza dance to this song, and your mom hums this while cooking. Safe to say this is the epitome of 'Japanese Inquisition'.

At it's heart, it is an adorable song about your first crush, a song sure to set your heart aflutter and remind you of the 13-year-old self, day-dreaming about something as simple as getting to walk along with that special someone on your way back home from school.

```
"Kami-sama arigatou
Unmei no itazura demo
Meguriaeta koto ga
Shiawase na no"

"Dear God, thank you
Even if it's just destiny pulling a prank on me,
I'm so glad of the fact that
We both had met"
```

#### 2) [Centimeter - The Peggies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCDJo1rXOW4&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=2)
This is strictly speaking from my experience - the outstanding quality of this song doesn't exactly correlate with the anime, *(Kanojo Okarishimasu, Rent-A-Girlfriend)*. But people who can't keep songs out of their head, beware: the song is sure to keep your head bobbing and feet tapping on an infinite loop.

Images this song might bring up in your mind range from that time you found your chest thumping as her leg brushed past yours and that moment when you made a perfect one-one eye contact with him and suddenly found your legs wobbling. 

```
"Dakara unmei datte shinjitai
Ima suu senchi chikazuitemo ii ka na
Mune wo saku yo furimuite kureru tabi ni"

"So this is why, I want to believe in fate!
Now, I think I want to get a few centimeters closer,
My chest, it beats more,
Every time you look back at me!"
```
#### 3) [Daddy Daddy Do - Masayuki Suzuki ft. Airi Suzuki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNuG1Csfmgg&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=3)
A high-school, rom-com anime done right. *Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai* a fantastic anime to eat some popcorn, kick back on your sofa, chuckle along and never be bored for a moment throughout it's 20-minutes long episodes. 

Same goes for it's choice of openings. Masayuki Suzuki is a legend in Japanese music and add in the mix Airi Suzuki, someone whom I ~~simped for~~ like listening to on a loop, this is a song to cherish.

This is the point where playful love turns into seductive foreplay and waiting to see who will be the first one to give in and lose head over heels. Because, let's be frank, love is war.

```
"Daddy, daddy, do
Hoshii nosa anata no subete ga
Damasaretara sore demo ii motto furuwasete"

"Daddy, daddy, do!
I want something like you, so just give up all of you
Even if I get tricked, that's fine
It just makes it more fun!"
```

### City Pop: For A Trip Through Nostalgia

#### 4) [Crazy For You - Saito Marina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hMcJAERPHE&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=4)
This is it. The most listened to song on my playlist. The only song from this list that I will sing in my wedding, hypothetical scenarios in 3..2..1...

Since this song, I've listened to Saito Marina sing originals and cover countless other songs from the 80s but this one is beyond special to me. Hard to express the feelings the melody evokes in my heart - a walk along the beach, hand holding, smiling as you glance at each other, knowing that given the time and place there's no other place you'd rather be, than with each other.
```
"Akiramenai yo my destiny (oh oh oh),
Onaji toki wo kazanetai
Motto!
Kotoba jatarinai omoi
Todoketai,
Hajimaru koto osorezu ni..."

"I won't give up on my destiny!
I want to spend my time with you,
More than anything,
These feelings that can't be expressed by words alone,
I want them to reach you,
Without the fear of trying to start things..."
```
#### 5) [Telephone Number - Junko Ohashi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRGwRm6uXv8&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=5)
For some odd reason, I found myself humming this songs as I was attending a pretty serious semester exam (safe to say I didn't do pretty well). A song with a catchy chorus like none, this is another song to sing to your crush, and hoping he will hear your whispers from 500m away and sweep you off your feet. 

Personally, this reminds me of the first time I tried flirting through the telephone and nearly broke down in nervousness before I could make it past the first minute. You get the picture. No, she and I are NOT married now.
```
[Chorus]:
A-Ooooh! 5-6-7-0-9!
```
#### 6) [Plastic Love - Saori Hayami (cover)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXWVF74AVBQ&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=6)
It's quite hard to bring up city pop and not mention *Plastic Love*. While Mariya Takeuchi's original version might be much closer to people's hearts, there is something about this live performance that just struck a chord with me. Maybe it's the supreme guitar playing and the performance in perfect sync with the drums, or Hayamin's vocal prowess, or maybe all of them.

I won't guarantee anything, but I have rarely listened to the original after I listened to this cover. As for the significance of this song in the city pop genre, there need not be said anything.

This song is legendary as it is.
```
"Totsuzen no kisu ya atsui manazashi de
Koi no puroguramu wo kuruwasenaide ne
Deai to wakare jouzu ni uchikonde
Jikan ga kureba owaru don't hurry!"

"Don't mess up the program of love
With your sudden kiss...
...or a fiery stare
Don't mess up my programs of love
I've input hellos and goodbyes so neatly
Everything comes to an end in due time, don't hurry!"
```

### Slow Songs - Romantic Partners For Life, Songs For The End Of The Journey

#### 7) [Sakura - Ikimonogakari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNgDURlUbfE&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=7)
Cherry blossoms, springs, rivers, fluttering hearts - a song in perfect sync with the Japanese nature and love. 

I might point out at this point that most of the songs I've in this playlist are lyrics videos, so even if you're new to Japanese music, you can follow along with the translated lyrics. And while the lyrics are more on the sentimental side of missing a loved one, be sure not to miss this song, because it is simply, art.
```
"Sakura hirahira maiorite ochite
Yureru omoi no take wo dakishimeta
Kimi to haru ni negai shi ano yume wa
Ima mo miete iru yo sakura maichiru..."

"The cherry blossoms fell, fluttering down
Embracing every bit of my fluttering love,
Even now, I'm still dreaming of seeing you this spring,
The cherry blossoms scatter..."
```
#### 8) [Koi Wo Shita No Wa - Aiko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkezyWiRgiw&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=8)
The best song from my favourite animation movie of all time, *Koe no Katachi (A Silent Voice)*, Japanese or other language. From what I've watched so far, no other movie comes close (at least in the 'Slice of Life' category). 

There is nothing to be ashamed of if you cried when the end credits rolled and this song came on. A beautiful, beautiful story of two people struggling with the circumstances involving each other, culminating with the perfect song. 

Please cherish the ones you love, you never know when it is the last time you get to call them by their name.
```
"Hajimete mo saigo mo ima mo,
Mau hanabira ni kizami okuru yo
Darling!
Ochiru ame ni utsuru futari
Sekai wa dare mo shiranai..."

"Beginning, ending, and this moment I'll engrave them all to,
Those dancing petals and send it to you,
Darling!
We two reflected in the falling rain,
Nobody in this world knows that..."
```

#### 9) [Nandemonaiya - RADWIMPS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8i21_6Isc&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=9)
I didn't have to struggle between this and *Sparkle* - *Nandemonaiya* is the best song from *Kimi no Nawa (Your Name)* by far. While I must thank the movie for introducing a lot of people to Japanese anime and songs in general, I am sure people would have been endeared to this masterpiece, with or without the movie.

A lovely song to sing on guitar to your loved one. Also the perfect movie to watch on Valentine's if you haven't already.
```
"Futari no aida toorisugita kaze wa doko kara sabishisa wo hakonde kita no
Naitari shita sono ato no sora wa yake ni sukitootteitari shitanda"

"The sorrowful gust of wind that blew right between you and me
Where did it find the loneliness it carried on the breeze?
Looking up at the sky after shedding a stream of tears
I could see for miles of blue, it's never been so clear"
```
#### 10) [Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari - Supercell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDE514XIJfU&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=11)
Space, night sky and star-crossed lovers, and might I say, the best song on *Bakemonogatari*, if not the best ending to any anime ever. If *Renai Circulation* is the excitement of a new crush, this song is the one that echoes through the skies whispering the name of your soulmate for eternities to come.

I've always understood this song as a prayer of someone who couldn't confess their love before it was too late (get a hint people!). Give this a listen, trust me you won't regret it.
```
"Itsumodoori no aruhi no koto
Kimi wa totsuzen tachiagari itta
'konya hoshi o mi ni yukou'..."

"On that ordinary day,
You suddenly stood up and said,
'Let's go stargazing tonight'..."
```

### Kenshi Yonezu
#### 11) [Lemon - Kenshi Yonezu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX_ViT4Ra7k&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=11)
Kenshi Yonezu deserves a different category of his own - I can't imagine a Japanese singer more popular abroad than he is right now. And *Lemon* is his *magnum opus*.

Honestly, not all romantic love has to be between couples. This song reminds me of how much my family and friends mean to me, and how I'd be at an utter loss if anything were to happen to them.

Incidentally, this is also the most viewed Japanese music video and rightly so - this is a song for the ages.

```
"Ano hi no kanashimi sae ano hi no kurushimi sae
Sono subete wo aishiteta anata to tomo ni
Mune ni nokori hanarenai nigai remon no nioi
Ame ga furiyamu made wa kaerenai
Ima demo anata wa watashi no hikari"

"Even the sadness from that day, even the pain from that day,
I loved it all, together with you
The bitter scent of lemons remains embedded in my heart
Can't make my way home 'til the rain lets up
Even now you remain my light"
```

#### 12) [Orion - Kenshi Yonezu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzAyrgSqeeE&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=12)
Another masterpiece. While I don't know how popular it is, the certainly is one of a kind. Maybe I have a thing for constellation, stars, prayers and promises.

I must admit, I was pretty torn between including this or *Uchihage Hanabi*, another romantic song that could replace well any other song from this playlist. Regardless, give both songs a listen, and maybe provide a verdict on which one deserves a spot here over the other. 

```
"Yume no naka de sae, doumo jouzu janai kokoro guai
Ki ni shinaidette nageita koto, naiteita koto
Hotsureta sode no ito hippatte, futto seiza wo tsukutte mitanda
Otagai no yubi wo, hoshi toshite
Sore wa hidoku detarame de, bokura warai aetanda
Soko ni anata ga ite kureta nara, sore de iinda"

"Even the contents of my dreams aren't that impressive, let alone the state of my heart,
'Don't bother yourself with it', I said as I lamented, and as I wept,
Tugging on an already unraveling sleeve, suddenly we tried to make a constellation,
As though both of our fingers were stars,
But that's all just cruel nonsense and we both laughed at the thought of it,
And there I realized that if you were by my side, I would be okay..."
```

#### 13) [Shunrai - Kenshi Yonezu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkNzxsaCunU&list=PL63_35IpRqoTJ_qyJoL2YSeYK-iYlUAqk&index=13)
And finally, my most treasured Kenshi Yonezu song of all time. While I was initially under the impression that this was some sort of dance song, I was pretty much blown away once I listened in closely with the translated lyrics.

For me, this song is the strongest in terms of lyrics from this playlist. And also the most difficult to sing along. Also the second most played song on my playlist.
```
"Kotoba ni suru no mo katachi ni suru no mo sono dore mo ga satoshi taba nakutte
Tada me o mitsume ta suruto anata wa futto yasashiku waratta n da
Shagare ta kokoro mo sazameku himitsu mo ki ga tsuke ba konagona ni natte
Setsuna no ma ni itami ni ni ta koi ga karada o hashitta n da"

"Putting it into words, or giving it a shape, either way, it's a bit shaky,
Because when I gazed into your eyes, you laughed, suddenly and gently,
My ragged voice, my loudly kept secret, before I knew it, they've gone to pieces,
In an instant, a love like pain had run through my body..."
```

There you have it, your lucky number 13 and my best wishes for a lovely day.
