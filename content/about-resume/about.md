**Quotes To Live By:**

- "Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves." - *Jung*

**Dedicated:**

To my **mom and dad**, thanks for bearing with my indecisive, weepy, overthinking and neglectful self, both of you have made me who I am today, my mom being my first computer teacher and my dad being my first spiritual mentor. In terms of your competition, there is no competition.

Except maybe my **sister**, who has been my source of inspiration and moral compass for all these years. Hope you conquer everything you've set out to do, you are my hero.
