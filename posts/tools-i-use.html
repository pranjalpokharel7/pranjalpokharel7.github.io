        This is just a simple list of tools I use for development. In no way is
        this meant to be strongly opinionated or a how-to for the best developer
        setup. This post is a work in progress and will be updated from time to
        time.

      <p>
        I was on Chromium (the OSS version) for the longest time, mainly due to
        the ability to natively switch user profiles. However, more recently,
        watching videos on youtube has become almost impossible for me on
        Chromium due to the aggressive response against ad-blockers (also
        against the extension

        for some reason). Brave might have been an alternative option
      </p>
      <p>Extensions I recommend for Firefox include,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>uBlock Origin - Ad Blocker</li>
        <li>Privacy Badger, Don't Track me Google - Privacy Extensions</li>
        <li>
          DF Youtube, YouTube Nonstop, Video Speed Controller, SponsorBlock for
          YouTube - Better YouTube Experience
        </li>
        <li>Old Reddit Redirect - Better Reddit Experience</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="editor-neovim">Editor: NeoVim</h3>
      <p>
        I used vim mode in VSCode for the longest time, but I must admit the
        native experience in NeoVim is something else. There are a lot of
        packages available today that you almost never have to leave your
        terminal for anything (eg, lsp protocol is native to nvim). I still have
        VSCode for debugging purposes and for some refactoring issues (eg, find
        and replace in multiple files is something I haven't figured out in
        NeoVim).

      <h3 id="note-taker-obsidian">Note Taker: Obsidian</h3>
      <p>
        Enough said. There isn't a better note taking app which is available
        offline. Even this blog post is being written in Obsidian (I have a
        workflow to export the markdown to html page). There is no need to use
        Notion, unless it's some sort of company policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might want to install the following community extensions to make the
        Obsidian experience just that better.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Natural Language Dates - Shortcut to add date/time while typing</li>
        <li>
          Pandoc Plugin - Access pandoc exports through command palette (you can
          directly use the terminal though)
        </li>
        <li>Omnisearch - Better search throughout your vault</li>
        <li>
          Paste URL Into Selection - Paste URLs directly into text (instead of
          manually typing square brackets and parenthesis in markdown)
        </li>
        <li>
          Typewriter Mode - Keep the current line in the middle of the screen
          (other options are available too)
        </li>
        <li>Obsidian Reading Time, Hider, Outliner - Better UI/UX</li>
        <li>Settings Search, Janitor - Utilities</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="video-player-mpv">Video Player: mpv</h3>
      <p>
        Lightweight and it just works. I can see someone making a strong case
        for vlc, but my requirements never really exceed everything provided by
        mpv.
