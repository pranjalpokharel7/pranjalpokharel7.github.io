        Yet another poorly written article about Flutter setup on Linux. As the
        big brain monkey I am, I installed it on my machine about 4 weeks prior
        and so, due to reasons I did not document my steps then, I don't have
        screenshots to explain things more visually. The length of this article
        does not correlate to productive learning - feel free to skip certain
        sections then bash me about it on Twitter later. Welcome to the rice
        fields [redacted]!

        Step 1 : "I am simply too chad to read the official docs"
      </h2>
      <p>
        Easiest way is to simply git clone the flutter repository then setup the
        path. Why not download the tarball over git? This way any new
        release-police catches up, you can <code>git pull</code> over without a
        worry.
      </p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1">
        <pre
          class="sourceCode bash"
        ><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git <span class="at">-b</span> stable</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        We will clone the stable branch (omit everything after the
        <code>-b</code> branch if living on the edge is your thing). Wherever
        you clone it, the next step is to update the $PATH variable in your
        shell config file. Don't know how to do that? In your home directory
        <code>~/</code>, you should have a config file named
        <code>.bashrc</code> (bash) or <code>.zshrc</code> (zsh) or something
        else depending upon the shell you use. Simply open the file and add the
        following lines -
      </p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2">
        <pre
          class="sourceCode bash"
        ><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># inside .bashrc</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">FLUTTER_HOME</span><span class="op">=</span>~/flutter</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">export</span> <span class="va">PATH</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="va">$FLUTTER_HOME</span>/bin:<span class="va">$PATH</span></span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        <code>FLUTTER_HOME</code> is the location to where you git cloned the
        flutter repo previously (mine is in the home directory). An experienced
        eye will notice that the PATH we provide is not the actual flutter
        directory, but the <code>bin</code> directory INSIDE the root
        <code>flutter</code> directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confused about the mumbo-jumbo regarding $PATH variable? This person
        here explains it in a single minute read -
        <a href="https://linuxconfig.org/linux-path-environment-variable/"
          >linux PATH environment variable</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2 id="step-2-call-a-doctor...but-not-for-me">
        Step 2 : "Call a doctor...but not for me!"
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you've completed the first step, the following command should execute
        without the <code>flutter: command not found</code> error -
      </p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb3">
        <pre
          class="sourceCode bash"
        ><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> flutter doctor</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        It will probably show you are missing the Android SDK and Android Studio
        (I'm assuming those are the flags that pop up). We will not touch that
        RAM gobbling monstrosity called Android Studio, but we will download the
        Android SDK which is super necessary.
      </p>
      <h2 id="step-3-cool-uncle-java">Step 3: "Cool uncle Java"</h2>
      <p>
        If you have had any experience coding in Java before, this step should
        be over in a flash. If not, it should still be over in a flash. Linux
        makes things easier - just install the Java Development Kit (JDK minimum
        version 8).
      </p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb4">
        <pre
          class="sourceCode bash"
        ><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># command for arch based distros</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> pacman <span class="at">-Ss</span> openjdk</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        The above command should fetch you a list of openjdk versions you can
        choose to install from. Any distro you use, finding openjdk for your
        system should be pretty easy from the official repositories (customary
        bow to Gentoo users).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: Some legacy flutter projects might not work on
        the latest jdk-16. If you encounter some weird error during the latter
        steps, make sure the jdk version is compatible with your project
        (openjdk-8 is always the safest bet).
      </p>
      <h2 id="step-4-hey-are-we-all-using-arch-or-what">
        Step 4 : "Hey, are we all using Arch or what?"
      </h2>
      <p>
        The steps should not be that different if you are not on an Arch-based
        distro, just that you will have to install it from source or go the
        Android Studio route. Updates on this will arrive as soon as I move onto
        a Debian machine, which might never happen, just saying...
      </p>
      <p>
        First things first - you will need the
        <code>android-tools</code> package that contains adb (android debug
        bridge), fastboot and some other tools, that will be useful if you plan
        not to use an emulator but a connected Android device for development.
        This should be available on the official repo -
      </p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb5">
        <pre
          class="sourceCode bash"
        ><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> sudo pacman <span class="at">-S</span> android-tools</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        Next, you will need to download the following four packages from the AUR
        - 1. Command Line Tools (<a
          href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/android-sdk-cmdline-tools-latest/"
          >android-sdk-cmdline-tools-latest</a
        >) 2. SDK Build-Tools (<a
          href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/android-sdk-build-tools/"
          >android-sdk-build-tools</a
        >) 3. SDK Platform-Tools (<a
          href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/android-sdk-platform-tools/"
          >android-sdk-platform-tools</a
        >) 4. SDK Platform (<a
          href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/android-platform/"
          >android-platform</a
        >)
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever I write here is a shameless copy of the following link -
        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Android#SDK_packages"
          >ArchWiki - SDK Packages</a
        >. Credit where credit's due, ArchWiki is a Godsend. You can also
        install the
        <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/android-emulator/"
          >emulator</a
        >
        package, but configuring the emulator without Android Studio is a bit
        contrived (docs don't help), and I have had quite a miserable experience
        with it. See this
        <a href="/posts/android-emulator-on-linux.html">post</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="step-5-reading-licenses-we-dont-do-that-here">
        Step 5 : "Reading licenses? We don't do that here!"
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you've successfully completed step 4, now's the time to accept some
        completely "innocuous" licenses.
      </p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb6">
        <pre
          class="sourceCode bash"
        ><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> sudo flutter doctor <span class="at">--android-licenses</span></span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        Notice the <code>sudo</code> access which is required. Flutter docs
        mention using an "elevated console", which is pretty easy to miss.
        Wasted an hour spamming this command and re-accepting android licenses
        without realizing I simply needed an "elevated console".
      </p>
      <p>
        If you run <code>flutter doctor</code> now, the only warning you should
        get is <code>Android Studio missing</code> which is optional either way.
      </p>
      <h2 id="step-6-ahh-shit-here-we-hello-world-again...">
        Step 6 : "Ahh shit, here we 'Hello World' again..."
      </h2>
      <p>
        Flutter docs have this part after setting up your editor. But I beg to
        differ - editors are secondary and running your first 'hello world' app
        comes first.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will need one of three things to run your first app - an Android
        device connected with <strong>USB debugging enabled</strong>, a running
        Android emulator or a Chrome browser (flutter's default app runs on the
        web too) - simply because android apps do not run out of the box on your
        desktop Linux machine. To see the devices that are available to run your
        app -
      </p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb7">
        <pre
          class="sourceCode bash"
        ><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> flutter devices</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        If it says <code>N devices connected</code> (N being a number) and lists
        the available devices, you are good to go. I will go into more details
        about setting up the emulator in future posts, since this post is
        already too long at this point. For now, go for Chrome, we are only
        looking to verify flutter setup anyway.
      </p>
      <p>To set up the default flutter project, run the command -</p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb8">
        <pre
          class="sourceCode bash"
        ><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># our-app is the name of the folder where we setup the project</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> flutter create our-app</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> cd our-app</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        This will create a folder with the project directory setup from the
        get-go.
        <code>cd</code> into the folder. Next, we will need to install flutter
        packages and then run the app, which can be done in a single step as,
      </p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb9">
        <pre
          class="sourceCode bash"
        ><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># requires internet connection</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> flutter run</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        First it will download all the packages (which is
        <code>flutter pub get</code> or <code>flutter install</code> if you run
        separately) into a system cache folder for use. If you have ever used
        the python package manager <code>pip</code> outside of the virtual
        environment, this process is similar to that. Which means if two
        projects share the same dependency and version, one install should work
        for both.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wait for <code>assembleDebug</code> to complete. Basically this installs
        Gradle and then builds the app for use. First build can take a long time
        to complete, patience among Flutter devs is highly underrated. Once this
        process is complete, the default counter app should launch on your
        Chrome browser.

        Below this I have listed some errors I had to encounter during this
        process which might be common to you. I still left out a lot of things
        to cover, select few being setting up editors, configuring emulator,
        setting up Google sign-in for emulator, more command line usage in the
        absence of Android Studio and more.

        I have named this article Part 1 so that my future-self will not come up
        with excuses to not cover these areas. Hope we stay alive until then.

      </p>
      <p>
        When you install packages from the AUR, by default it is stored in the
        <code>/opt/</code> directory. Usually, the files within this directory
        can only be modified with root access, hence the permission denied
        error. You can do one of the following things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Run <code>sudo flutter run</code> to bypass the permission
          restrictions. Even flutter itself tells you this is a
          <strong>bad practice</strong>, don't be me and spend your time
          cleaning up multiple root spawned process (more on that later).
        </li>
        <li>
          Move the <code>android-sdk</code> directory to someplace else where
          permissions are not an issue. You will need to update the $PATH
          variable for this one though, which was not the case for
          <code>/opt</code> directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use <code>chown</code> to modify user permissions to allow read/write
          access for normal users. This is what I did, just marking individual
          files that were causing the permission errors and chowning 777.
        </li>
        <li>
          ArchWiki recommends creating new user and with permissions for that
          specific user to read/write into android-sdk folder (check the link I
          posted above under section 4 of installing SDK packages).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>2. "Do I always need to be online to run my app?"</strong></p>
      <p>
        Nope, but you will need it for the first build and downloading packages
        that haven't been previously installed.

      <p>
        Did you 'sudo flutter run'? Chances are the OS is not able to free up
        the resources because you ran flutter as root. Quick check with
        <code>htop</code> or <code>top</code> to verify. See if there are
        multiple <code>dart</code> processes still running even after you've
        closed flutter and <code>killall dart</code>. Sometimes this problem
        also persists when you close vscode even though you did not do anything
        <code>sudo</code> with it, I'm guessing it's got something to do with
        how the dart intellisense works, but it's just speculation on my part.
