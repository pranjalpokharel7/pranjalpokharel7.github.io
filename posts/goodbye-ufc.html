  <main>
    <p>I have been a hardcore fan of the Ultimate Fighting Championship
      (UFC) since 2020. I vividly remember watching highlights of Adesanya vs
      Costa, and then hopping onto the JRE podcast and consuming every MMA
      episode I could find. I immediately started flipping through the pages
      of history, starting from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jNiNqZlDz0">Goodridge's violent
        elbows to kick off UFC 1</a> to the gladiator bloodbath of <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocsu8P4-GS4">Lawler vs MacDonald
        2</a>. I watched Brock Lesnar claim <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTsSVOgc0ng">"Frank Mir had a
        horseshoe up his ass"</a> and McGregor punching the upper stratosphere
      of superstardom in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qrVQwjieac">13 seconds</a>.
      Anthony Petis showing off his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhgOtbbU1UM">taijutsu kick</a> and
      Anderson Silva <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzNpq0EbiHE">entering the matrix
        against Forrest Griffin</a>. Khabib <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4zP8fyRnfI">toying with Michael
        Johnson</a> and Mighty Mouse bending reality with an <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOg-wY3cISg">unbelievable
        suplex-to-armbar submission</a>. I was fucking hooked.</p>
    <p>I remember taking a distributed systems test with zero preparation,
      just because Leon ROCKY Edwards <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cNpXvoDhzo">pulled the shit out
        of the fire</a> when the entire world thought it was impossible that
      late in the fight. I went for a run at 6 AM with a 100-degree fever 
      because Israel Adesanya said he was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/C8Fxo4meoCk">"prepared to die"</a>
      in that 5th round vs Gastelum. I became an instant fan of the human
      being known as Dustin Poirier <a href="https://youtu.be/6yu2AWK4rxo?si=NaHZFoald226zetL&amp;t=691">when
        he knocked out McGregor</a> and then watched with teary eyes when he
      made that walkout against Makhachev on <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjtsR03hPpE&amp;list=RDHjtsR03hPpE&amp;start_radio=1">"Shine
        Bright Like a Diamond"</a>. I made strong friendships where we could
      talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz4ESoO7SDk">grabbing Ilia Apturo
        Topturo by the scruff of his neck</a> and laugh out loud without
      missing a beat. Hell, I even took Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) classes for a
      month because Joe Rogan convinced me everyone HAS to learn how to fight.
      Yes, the sport is actually MMA, but since the UFC is THE premier
      organisation for MMA, the general public usually treats the two terms as
      synonymous.</p>
    <p>The last statement is where the problem lies. For years, we fans have
      been sweeping multiple red flags of the UFC brass under our green
      carpets, simply because they are the best in the business. From
      disproportionate fighter pay causing Francis Ngannou to take his massive
      balls to boxing, to Uncle Dana proclaiming his love for Jon Jones after
      every felony, doping violation, and blatant ducking charges; from <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6ZWh7dKC0d4">"who gives a shit"</a>
      about eyepokes to outright <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/O1QxWemQNZ8">deceptive contract
        signings</a>; from scandalous weight scale issues that has it's own <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship_controversies#Scale_gate">Wikipedia
        section</a> to the shoving of gambling ads down our throats until we
      choke and die broke one day. But everything was "forgiven" as long as we
      got to enjoy the best fights put between the best fighters in the
      world.</p>
    <p>Not until now. On his most recent "what's up everybody"
      <del>segment</del> lazy-promotion-slop, Uncle Dana announced Paddy
      Pimblett vs Justin Gaethje for the main event of UFC 324 for the
      <em>interim</em> lightweight title. Sweet, one more strikefest that will
      surely turn out to be a banger...except when you realize the champion of
      the division is still there (defend or vacate!), the number one
      contender just won a "number one contender's" fight, and the 2nd and 3rd
      ranked fighters in the division are probably going to fight for a
      gimmick BMF belt. And this headlines over the co-main Nunes vs Harrison,
      which is actually for the lineal championship (the disrespect on women's
      MMA is just toxic). And you choose not to match up O'Malley vs Umar,
      which would have made for the clear next contender for the bantamweight
      title - instead, they are fighting different opponents on the same
      fucking card! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y4bF77BAe10">Dana
        White privilege</a> absolutely stinks on this card!
    </p>
    <p>Volk vs Lopes 2!? Did Dana send Mosvar to Dagestan for 2-3 years and
      forget? You make Volk sit for 9 months just to make the same matchup
      again, when this could likely turn out to be his retirement fight? Did
      they use "AI" to make these matchups??</p>
    <p>For an analogy, imagine on the day of the world cup final 2022,
      Argentina decides to pack their bags and go home, and insists any
      other two teams of FIFA's choosing play for an "interim" world cup -
      this interim cup being defended months later at a time of Argentina's
      choosing. Remember the word "interim" because anyone who wins this final
      isn't actually the legit champion, the trophy is a cheap replica, and
      the winning fans will have to pause their celebrations until they defeat
      Argentina in some undetermined time in the future. OKAY (!?), says
      FIFA.</p>
    <p>Then, instead of pitting the second finalists, France, against one of
      the other semi-finalists, Croatia/Morocco, to settle this "interim"
      final, they think "hmm, Cristiano Ronaldo is very popular on Instagram,
      hell let's have him play the finals". Lo and behold, Portugal is in the
      fucking finals!</p>
    <p>You re-enact that Anakin-Padme meme and reply, "You have such a good
      sense of humour, FIFA president...it was a joke, right?" Giving in to
      the dark side, Anakin Infantino replies, "You underestimate my power!",
      and decides that Italy, which didn't even qualify for the tournament,
      will be the other finalist!</p>
    <p>"But why, that doesn't make any sense!", you say.</p>
    <p>Anakintino replies, "Well, you see, Italy has refused to play any
      other World Cup match in the future if it doesn't get to play in this
      interim final. And considering their rich history of winning 4 finals
      before, we'll allow them one more crack at it."</p>
    <p>"But what about France? Or even Croatia and Morocco? Clearly, at
      least one of them is the right contender for the title!"</p>
    <p>"Silence!", the pink-faced Emperor Palpantino says calmly, "I hate
      that French football team! That entitled brat Mbappe makes those huge
      lumps of cash at PSG and still dares to ask me MORE money for playing in
      this final? Last week I spent a few million on a blackjack hand, and I
      am the one who gets shit on social media? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tDniownNd4">That's fucking
        illegal!</a>"</p>
    <p>"Wait, what..."</p>
    <p>"As for Croatia and Morocco, we're gonna make their third-place match
      for the 'Bad Motherfuckin' Footballers (BMF)' cup. Surely that's a
      win-win! Now, hold this camera as I have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0GHSGxks-xs">Nina Drama oil me up...</a>"</p>
    <p>You do your thing, Dana Pinkman. I won't give a second of my
      attention to this clown show. Maybe all of this has been a master plan
      to get me hooked on Powerslap Season 12809, and I hope you got what you
      wanted. Goodbye UFC, it wasn't me, it was you.</p>
