        As you can guess from the description, emulators are in fact a "luxury"
        item only for soydevs with more memory on their PCs than subscribers to
        PewDiePie. Turns out, I am one of those and my laptop can handle me
        running an emulator and writing this on Emacs simultaneously. Peace
        peace - I say with a posed look. On a side note, if your RAM isn't
        soldered and/or you have some extra slots, just get an upgrade dude. It
        doesn't cost much compared to how much headaches you need to go through
        on a 4GB ENIAC, flutter or not.

        We just planted our first flutter grain a while back and while it was
        "fun" playing with the counter app on Chrome, we will now bring out the
        'heavy' guns. First, we re-open the ArchWiki page on Android and
        download that emulator package. Again, if you're on other distros, look
        up the specific installation, cause I'm not that dedicated to writing
        tech articles yet :).

        Step 2 : "From DVDs to AVDs, we all grew up"
      </h2>
      <p>
        The fundamental thing about emulators is that they only go as far as to
        emulate a specific hardware layout. You need some software to run over
        the emulated hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) as something that contains
        configuration on how an Android device should run. A virtual android
        device, as the abbreviation says, over which you will be able to run
        your app. There are a lot of AVDs you can choose from, seeing that you
        have Android running on everywhere ranging from mobile devices to smart
        watches.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you completed the installation of <code>android-sdk</code>
        properly as a part of the previous article, you should have
        <code>sdkmanager</code> available from the command line (might need to
        log out or restart the system to have <code>sdkamanager</code> available
        after initial install.
      </p>
      <pre><code>$ sdkmanager --list</code></pre>
      <p>
        The above command will list out all the available android system-images
        from which you can create an AVD - you will download a system-image
        depending on the architecture you're working on.
      </p>
      <pre><code># expected output
...
platforms;android-30
platforms;android-31 ... # Android SDK Platform
...
system-images;android-31;google_apis;arm64-v8a ...
system-images;android-31;google_apis;x86_64 ... # Google APIs Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image
system-images;android-31;google_apis_playstore;arm64-v8a ...
system-images;android-31;google_apis_playstore;x86_64 ...
...</code></pre>
      <p>
        The number 31 is just the Android API version - newer the better, unless
        you are specific in not using the latest one. I am on an x86_64
        architecture (i.e. my laptop) so I will download the latest system-image
        and SDK platform correspondingly.
      </p>
      <pre><code>$ sdkmanager &quot;platforms;android-31&quot;
$ sdkmanager &quot;system-images;android-31;google_apis;x86_64&quot; </code></pre>
      <p>
        Following this (and successful installation based on part 1), you should
        have
        <code>avdmanager</code> available from the command line - as the name
        suggests, we will be using this tool to manage our AVDs.
      </p>
      <pre><code>$ avdmanager create avd -n myavdname -k &quot;system-images;android-31;google_apis;x86_64&quot;</code></pre>
      <p>
        The above command creates an AVD with the name 'myavdname'. Do not
        choose custom hardware profile for now, just go for default option. You
        can always edit the config files later if necessary.

        Hopefully this section hasn't been too lengthy. Next, we boot up our
        emulator. About damn time.

      <p>On your console, type the following command -</p>
      <pre><code>$ emulator -list-avds</code></pre>
      <p>
        If your newly created AVD pops up on the list, congratulations, it's
        your birthday today!
      </p>
      <pre><code>$ emulator -no-snapshot -avd myavdname </code></pre>
      <p>
        The <code>-no-snapshot</code> command makes sure the emulator does not
        save state on exit i.e. your emulator will boot up as if your Android
        phone is on cold boot every time. Just my preference, you can remove
        this and your emulator should launch just fine. Refer to the official
        android developer article on
        <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline"
          >other command line options</a
        >.

          >this article</a
        >. Reason I won't explain this over here is because I've never had
        problems with it, and better not take word from a developer who hasn't
        had a bug on the issue. Honestly, it wouldn't hurt to go through the
        emulator section on the linked website.

        <code>cd</code> into your flutter project directory. Time to run your

        Also, let me know if you want something more related to flutter, can be
        setting up editors for example. Honestly though, I am just tired and
        need some rest from this app development hangover.

      <p><strong>1. "Navigation buttons on the emulator don't work"</strong></p>
      <p>
        Honestly, I never got them to work. By default, the on-screen navigation
        buttons are hidden - I enabled them and used them as substitute. You'll
        need to modify some config files for this. Navigate inside your
        <code>~/.android</code> directory (usually located in the home page) and
        then <code>avd/[avd-name]</code> within which you should see the
        <code>config.ini</code> file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Full path might be something like,
        <code>~/.android/avd/myavdname/config.ini</code>. Inside the file, edit
        the line,
      </p>
      <pre><code>hw.keyboard = yes</code></pre>
      <p>to</p>
      <pre><code>hw.keyboard = no</code></pre>
      <p>
        This should bring up your on-screen navigation keys. However, this can
        disable your keyboard to emulator input, and you'll have to press the
        touch screen keyboard manually. Well, let's just hope you are not
        working on a blogging app :eyes:.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can go through other configuration parameters as well and change
        them as required.

      <p>
        Launch emulator with <code>-no-snapshot</code> option. I was getting
        pretty irritated by this and I stopped saving state once and for all.
        You can also try wiping the previously stored snapshots, simply pass in
        the <code>-wipe-data</code> parameter.

      <p>
        You can try downloading from the source directly, which is our little
        overlord called Google.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code
          >https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sys-img/google_apis/x86_64-30_r10.zip</code
        >
        - this link downloads the system-image for android-30 SDK, just replace
        the
        <code>x86_64-30</code> with the match from your
        <code>sdkmanger --list</code> output.
      </p>
      <p>
        Extract the downloaded zip to the <code>system-images</code> folder
        inside <code>/opt/android-sdk/</code> (assuming you installed from AUR
        there) and rename it appropriately. For instance, my final full path is
        -
        <code>/opt/android-sdk/system-images/android-30/google_apis/x86_64</code
        >.
