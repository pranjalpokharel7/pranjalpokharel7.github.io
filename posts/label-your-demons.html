        The finale of Conjuring 2 circles around Ed being stalked by The Nun in
        a race against time, with Lorraine frantically trying to find the name
        of the demon . In
        <a href="https://youtu.be/KE-9ZPx_Rdw?si=wRwrfXnvcmd3Q4pl&amp;t=76"
          >this powerful climactic scene</a
        >, Lorraine proclaims "you name gives me dominion over you demon, and I
        do know your name!", and as soon as Lorraine calls out The Nun by it's
        name, it is condemned back to hell. As a child, I was totally convinced
        from watching Hindi horror movies that I needed to recite the Hanuman
        Chalisa by heart if I was to scare away the ghosts beneath my bed
        (spoiler: I still don't know the entire mantra by heart). The second
        Conjuring movie didn't go the prayer or the exorcism route - it was
        based on a simple premise that once the 'unknown' is identified, it
        ceases to be horror. Once you remove the lighting effects, the spooky
        soundtrack, and the spooky makeup, you 'know' that there is just a
        person underneath and nothing to fear.

        My sister once asked my uncle why human beings were scared of the dark
        (I don't know what age she was, from all accounts she was a child and
        wise beyond her age). He replied, "We are scared of the dark because we
        don't know what's in there, and we always fear the unknown. Once we turn
        on the lights, we are sure and unafraid." A poignant answer indeed,
        though I am only recently understanding the weight behind those words.

        Sometime around the final year of my engineering, I started smoking.
        Though I was never a chain smoker and I only smoked when I was drunk, I
        also knew that it didn't really feel 'cool' as I thought it would. It
        wasn't that hard for me to promise myself I'd never smoke again as I
        didn't have any physical withdrawal symptoms. When the boys gathered for
        a Friday night celebration and brought out the drinks, I'd initially
        claim I was abstaining and would just observe everyone having fun.
      </p>
      <p>"C'mon man, it's just one drink."</p>
      <p>
        That one sip would take away my dignity and make me feel the like the
        worthless slug at the bottom of a bottomless pit. I'd grab my hands full
        of anything I could reach - junk food, alcohol, cigarettes, weed. I
        already feel shitty anyway so let me numb this feeling even more.
      </p>
      <p>"Hey man, isn't that your third cigarette in the last 5 minutes?"</p>
      <p>
        My friend's thoughts pierced into my soul. Never had I ever 'wasted' a
        freshly lit cigarette into the ashtray and never have I since. For all
        my self-rationalization of smoking only occasionally, here I was an
        addict in practical observation. That was about 7-8 months ago. I never
        understood why, despite never having cravings for smoking on any other
        day, I would go on an all-out bender the moment I took a single puff.
        Until now.

        Most recently, I had been conversing with ChatGPT (the only therapist I
        can afford :sob:) and it suggested a peculiar term called 'abstinence
        violation effect'. From what I've understood with my limited knowledge,
        it's an effect in which an abstaining person, at the first sight of a
        possible relapse, goes into the mode of "I already failed, so I may as
        well extract maximum relief". My friends who didn't see smoking once as
        'relapsing', were okay with just that, but me being the self-identified
        abstaining person couldn't handle the feeling of calling myself a
        failure.
      </p>
      <p>Abstinence Violation Effect.</p>
      <p>
        As soon as I was able to label this feeling, I realized similar patterns
        in my other behaviors. I would abstain from using my phone for a day,
        and feel awesome having managed that feat. Yet, the next time I scrolled
        reels for even 15 minutes, my brain went into overdrive declaring I'm
        worthless for going back to my phone addiction, and trapped me into
        another social media session of over 2-4 hours.

      <p>
        <em
          >"When abstinence violation occurs, individuals typically enter a
          state of cognitive dissonance, defined as an aversive experience
          resulting from the discrepancy created by having two or more
          simultaneous and inconsistent cognitions. Abstinence violators realize
          that their actions (e.g. “I drank”) do not line up with their personal
          goal (e.g. “I want to abstain”) and feel compelled to resolve the
          discrepancy." - 2013, Principles of Addiction</em

        <em
          >"Put simply, the AVE (Abstinence Violation Effect) occurs when a
          client perceives no intermediary step between a lapse and a relapse.
          For example, overeaters may have an AVE when they express to
          themselves, “one slice of cheesecake is a lapse, so I may as well go
          all-out, and have the rest of the cheesecake.” That is, since they
          have violated the rule of abstinence, they “may as well” get the most
          out of the lapse." - 2002, Encyclopedia of Psychotherapy</em

        It's just been three days since I labelled my inner demon. And in these
        three days I feel slightly more powerful, that even if I find myself
        indulging in some celebrity gossip videos, I can curse the AVE demon and
        get out of my bed. To the reader, it might seem like one of those new
        year resolutions that I will give up on by the next week. But inside, I
        know. I feel. Years of not finding out "what's wrong with me", and now
        knowing that not only is there a name I can attach to this feeling, but
        there are a lot of people who are going through their own personal
        battles. I feel empathy for the drunk uncle in my neighborhood who just
        can't stop drinking when he gets it going. Deep down we are the same.

        Turn on the lights. Label your demons. Recognize when they are trying to
        plunder your self esteem and call them out by their name.
